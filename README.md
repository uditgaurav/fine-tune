## Fine-Tune

Welcome to the Fine-Tune repository! This repository contains code for fine-tuning pre-trained language models using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Fine-tuning allows you to train a pre-trained language model on your specific task or dataset, which can lead to improved performance and better results.

### Installation

To use Fine-Tune, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the necessary Python packages such as PyTorch, Transformers, and other dependencies required for fine-tuning language models.

### Usage
The Fine-Tune repository provides easy-to-use scripts for fine-tuning pre-trained language models on your specific task or dataset. Here are the general steps to use Fine-Tune:

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uditgaurav/fine-tune.git
```
- Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

__Prepare your data:__ Fine-tuning requires a labeled dataset for your specific task. You need to preprocess your data and format it according to the input requirements of the pre-trained language model you want to fine-tune.

__Fine-tune the model:__ 
- Use the provided scripts [fine_tune.py](./scripts/fine_tune.py) to fine-tune the pre-trained language model on your data. The scripts include options for hyperparameter tuning, model architecture selection, and other customization options.

- Provide the prompts and completions in CSV format in [prompts_and_completions.csv](./prompts_and_completions.csv) file.

__Evaluate the fine-tuned model:__ 
- Once the fine-tuning is complete, you can evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on your evaluation dataset using the provided evaluation scripts. You can compare the results with the pre-trained model to assess the improvement in performance.

- The sample output is stored in [fine_tuned_data.txt](./fine_tuned_data.txt) file.
